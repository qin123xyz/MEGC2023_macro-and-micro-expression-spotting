# MEGC2023_macro-and-micro-expression-spotting
Because deep learning method is limited to dataset amount and discrepancy, it behaves poorly when facing unseen dataset compared with Optical Flow method.
Overall,we use the Optical flow to complete the facial expression spotting task.
More importantly,we use openface2.0 to accurately align face in unseentest_CAS^3 and so get better result in MEGC2023.
